# **The Complex Systems Approach ** {-}

Complexity research transcends the boundaries between the classical scientific disciplines and is a hot topic in physics, mathematics, biology, economy as well as psychology and the life sciences. This course will discuss techniques that allow for the study of human behaviour from the perspective of the Complexity Sciences, specifically, the study of complex physical systems that are alive and display complex adaptive behaviour such as learning, development and creativity. Contrary to what the term “complex” might suggest, complexity research is often about finding simple models/explanations that are able to describe a wide range of qualitatively different behavioural phenomena. “Complex” generally refers to the object of study: Complex systems are composed of many constituent parts that interact with one another across many different temporal and spatial scales to generate behaviour at the level of the system as a whole, in complex systems “everything is interacting with everything”. 

The idea behind many methods for studying the dynamics of complex systems is to exploit the fact that “everything is interacting” and quantify the degree of periodicity, nonlinearity, context sensitivity or resistance to perturbation (resilience) of system behaviour. Applications in the behavioural sciences are very diverse and concern analyses of continuous time or trial series data such as response times, heart rate variability or EEG to assess proficiency of skills, or health and well-being. Complexity methods can also be used for the analysis of categorical data, such as behaviour observation of dyadic interactions (client-therapist, child-caregiver), daily experience sampling, social and symptom networks. The complex systems approach to behavioural science often overlaps with the idiographical approach of “the science of the individual”, that is, the goal is not to generalise properties or regularities to universal or statistical laws that hold at the level of infinitely large populations, but to apply general principles and universal laws that govern the adaptive behaviour of all complex systems to a specific case, in a specific context, at a specific moment in time.

The main focus of the course will be hands-on data-analysis. Practical sessions will follow after a lecture session in which a specific technique will be introduced.

We will cover the following topics:     

*	Theoretical background of phase transitions (self-organised criticality), synchronisation (coupling dynamics) and resilience (resistance to perturbation) in complex dynamical systems and networks.    
*	Simple models of linear and nonlinear dynamical behaviour (Linear & logistic growth, Predator-Prey dynamics, Deterministic chaos),    
*	Analysis of (multi-) scale dependence in time and trial series (Entropy, Relative roughness, Standardized Dispersion Analysis, (multi-fractal) Detrended Fluctuation Analysis).   
*	Quantification of temporal patterns in time and trial series including dyadic interactions (Phase Space Reconstruction, [Cross-] Recurrence Quantification Analysis).    
*	Dynamical network analyses for univariate (recurrence networks) and multivariate time series (multiplex recurrence networks).    
*	Using the method of surrogate data analysis (constrained realisations of time series data) to test hypotheses about the nature of the data generating process.      


## Learning outcomes {-}

After completing a course you will able to:   

*	Simulate linear, nonlinear and coupled dynamics using simple models.
*	Conduct (multi-fractal) Detrended Fluctuation Analysis and related techniques to quantify global and local scaling relations.
*	Conduct Recurrence Quantification Analysis and related techniques to quantify temporal patterns, synchronisation and coupling direction.
*	Conduct analyses on (multiplex) Recurrence Networks to quantify structure and dynamics of (multivariate) time series.

Naturally the (depth of) topics discussed will be limited by the duration of the course.

### For whom are these courses designed? {-}
The courses are designed for all researchers who are interested in acquiring hands-on experience with applying research methods and analytic techniques to study human behaviour from the perspective of Complexity Science. Prior knowledge is not required, some experience using R is recommended.

### Admission requirements {-}
During the course we will mostly be using the R statistical software environment. Basic experience with R is highly recommended (e.g. installing packages, calling functions that run analyses, handling and plotting data). We also offer a module for the Jamovi software with which the most basic analyses can be conducted. Using Jamovi does not require any prior knowledge of R, but you will not be able to use more advanced features of certain analyses.

Please bring your own laptop to the course. We will help you to install the necessary open source software, all of which can run on Windows, MacOS and most likely also on common varieties of Unix/Linux. The specifications for your computer are simply this: You need to be able to connect to a wireless network (wifi) and you should be able to install and run R (https://www.r-project.org). In addition, you might want to be able to use RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com) and Jamovi (https://www.jamovi.org).

If you do not have the resources to bring a laptop that meets the required specifications, please let us know in advance so we can try to find an alternative solution.


## **Literature** {-}

### Pre-course literature: {-}

It will be helpful to read the following articles before the first day of the course:

Links to online materials on specific topics will be provided (*Study Materials*) that may provide additional explanation and information about key concepts. These materials are not obligatory, but highly recommended to study at least once.

### Notes about this book and the assignments {-}

The texts in the chapters of this book are somewhat of a work in progress, and are intended as a rough introductory guide to accompany the lectures. Sometimes, you will notice a paragraph or chapter rather resembles a set of lecture notes instead of a self-contained text. Do not hesitate to let us know if you think anything is unclear or too far out of context for you to understand.

An essential part of the course are the assignments that are available online and are linked to from the course pages, for example: https://complexity-methods.github.io/courses/helsinki-workshop-2020/day1_2/


```{block2, imp, type='rmdimportant'}
 The text inside these blocks provides important information about the course, the assignments, or the exam.
```


```{block2, ken, type='rmdkennen'}
 The text inside these blocks provides examples, or, information about a topic you should pay close attentiont to and try to understand.
```


```{block2, note, type='rmdnote'}
 The text inside these blocks provides a note, a comment, or observation.
```


```{block2, think, type='rmdselfThink'}
The content in these blocks are often questions about a topic, or, suggestions about connections between different topics discussed in the book and the assignments. You should decide for yourself if you need to dig deeper to answer the questions or if you want to discuss the content. One way to find an answer or start a discussion is to open a thread in the discussion forum on Blackboard labelled *ThinkBox*.
```


```{block2, amuse, type='rmdentertain'}
 The content in these blocks is provided as entertainment :) 
```
